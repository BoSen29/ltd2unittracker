_“Now hear: I begin with nothingness. Nothingness is the same as the fullness. In infinity full is as good as empty. Nothingness is empty and full. You might just as well say anything else about nothingness, for instance, that it is white, or black, or that it does not exist, or that it exists. That which is endless and eternal has no qualities, since it has all qualities._

_“We call this nothingness or fullness the Pleroma. Therein both thinking and being cease, since the eternal and endless possess no qualities. No one is in it, for he would then be distinct from the Pleroma, and would possess qualities that would distinguish him as something distinct from the Pleroma._

_“In the Pleroma there is nothing and everything. It is fruitless to think about the Pleroma, for this would mean self-dissolution._




_“We must, therefore, distinguish the qualities of the Pleroma. These qualities are pairs of opposites, such as “the effective and the ineffective, the fullness and the emptiness, the living and the dead, the different and the same, light and darkness, hot and cold, force and matter, time and space, good and evil, the beautiful and the ugly, the one and the many, etc._

_“The pairs of opposites are the qualities of the Pleroma that do not exist, because they cancel themselves out. As we are the Pleroma itself, we also have all these qualities in us. Since our nature is grounded in differentiation, we have these qualities in the name and under the sign of differentiation, which means:_

_“First: these qualities are differentiated and separate in us; therefore they do not cancel each other out, but are effective. Thus we are the victims of the pairs of opposites. The Pleroma is rent within us._



_S: “Take a piece of the liver, in place of the whole, and eat it.”_

_I: “What are you demanding? This is absolute madness. This is desecration, necrophilia. You make me a guilty party to this most hideous of all crimes.”_

_S: “You have devised the most horrible torment for the murderer, which could atone for his act. There is only one atonement: abase yourself and eat.”_

_I: “I cannot—I refuse—I cannot participate in this horrible guilt.”_

_S: “You share in this guilt.”_

_I: “I? Share in this guilt?”_

_S: “You are a man, and a man has committed this deed.”_

_I: “Yes, I am a man—I curse whoever did this for being a man, and I curse myself for being a man.”_

_S: “So, take part in his act, abase yourself and eat. I need atonement.”_

_I: “So shall it be for your sake, as you are the soul of this child.”_

_I kneel down on the stone, cut off a piece of the liver and put it in my mouth. My gorge rises—tears burst from my eyes—cold sweat covers my brow—a dull sweet taste of blood—I swallow with desperate efforts—it is impossible—once again and once again—I almost faint—it is done. The horror has been accomplished._

_S: “I thank you.”_

_She throws her veil back—a beautiful maiden with ginger hair._

_S: “Do you recognize me?”_

_I: “How strangely familiar you are! Who are you?”_

_S: “I am your soul.”_
